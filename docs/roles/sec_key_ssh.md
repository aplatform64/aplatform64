```yaml
{% include "../examples/sec_key_ssh.yml" %}
```

The playbook can be run by executing:

```shell
# Set ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS to the default location. Change as needed.
ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS="${HOME}/.ansible/collections"
ansible-playbook "${ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS}/ansible_collections/serdigital64/security/playbooks/sec_key_ssh.yml"
```

## Role Parameters

### Actions

- Parameters should be declared as task level vars as they are intented to be dynamic.

```yaml
