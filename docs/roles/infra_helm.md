ansible-playbook "${ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS}/ansible_collections/serdigital64/infrastructure/playbooks/infra_helm.yml"
```

    - bkp_archive
  - serdigital64.system
    - sys_package
    - sys_repository
    - sys_user

### Prerequisites

The Ansible engine must be already installed and configured for privileged access and remote execution.
