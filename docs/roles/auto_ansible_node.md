# Ansible Role: serdigital64.automation.auto_ansible_node

## Purpose

Automate the management of Ansible Managed Nodes.

Supported features in the current version:

- Create managed node user.
- Grant root privilege to managed node user.
- Provision OpenSSH Key for remote access from managed node.

Notice that first time usage requires a bootstrap process where the role is run using temporary access credentials to perform the initial setup.

The **auto_ansible_node** Ansible-Role is part of the [A:Platform64](https://github.com/aplatform64/aplatform64) project and is available in the [automation](https://aplatform64.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collections/automation) Ansible-Collection.

## Usage

The following example is an **Ansible Playbook** that includes all the supported features:

[use this link if viewing the doc on github](https://github.com/aplatform64/automation/blob/main/playbooks/auto_ansible_node.yml)

```yaml
{% include "../examples/auto_ansible_node.yml" %}
```

The playbook can be run by executing:

```shell
# Set ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS to the default location. Change as needed.
ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS="${HOME}/.ansible/collections"
ansible-playbook "${ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS}/ansible_collections/serdigital64/automation/playbooks/auto_ansible_node.yml"
```

## Role Parameters
