## Overview

**A:Platform64** is an automated infrastructure-as-code management platform based on Ansible.

### Design Principles

The platform is designed to take full control of the target infrastructure under the following principles:

- **Automate everything**: all management tasks should be automated. Exceptions should be carefully evaluated and only used when no automation is possible.
- **Separate code from end-state configuration**: automation scripts must be developed to define a clear and well-documented parameter interface for setting end-state and behaviour data.
- **Ansible Roles must be specialized**: roles will be used to manage single components or services. Dependencies must be clearly documented for cases where the role relies on features provided by other roles.
- **Infrastructure data model**: the infrastructure will use a data model to represent the target end-state and run-time behaviour. The model includes the following elements:
  - _Site_: Represents a group of Nodes that are managed by the same Control Node.
  - _Node_: Compute node that is capable of hosting software components and that is fully managed by the Control Node.
  - _Component_: Individual software product that is installed in a Node.
  - _Service_: Group of Components configured in one or more Nodes to serve a particular function.
- **Multi-platform friendly**: roles must be prepared to separate platform-specific code into individual files that can be loaded on-demand. Roles should not be allowed to execute on platforms that are not supported.
- **Test everything**: roles must include testing code to check platform compatibility, code sanity, standardization, integration and functionality.

### Architecture

The platform defines the following components:

- **Control Node**: compute node that will host the Ansible engine and the **A:Platform64** platform.
- **Management Node**: compute nodes that will me managed by **A:Platform64**
- **Site**: group of hosts that shares a set of configuration files. Sites can be used to isolated environments (e.g.: prod, dev, test, etc.)

Communication between the **Control Node** and the **Management Nodes** will be done using OpenSSH and regular Linux user accounts with public/private key pairs.
Root privilege will be provided by Sudo.

The **Control Node** will have the following directory structure to store **A:Platform64** components:

| Path         | Content                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| etc/         | Configuration files and keys                                     |
| inventories/ | Ansible inventory files, host_vars and group_vars                |
| collections/ | Ansible Collections installed from Ansible-Galaxy                |
| roles/       | Custom Ansible Roles                                             |
| playbooks/   | Custom Ansible Playbooks                                         |

| tests/       | Ansible playbooks for testing Custom Ansible Roles and Playbooks |
| vars/        | Ansible variables for custom playbooks and roles                 |
| logs/        | Execution logs                                                   |
| var/         | Variable and temporal data store                                 |
| bin/         | Shell scripts                                                    |
| docs/        | Repository for storing site-specific documentation               |

The directory structure and configuration are automatically created during the [Deployment Procedure](#deployment)

### Automation Scripts

The platform uses Ansible Roles to implement automation scripts. Roles are grouped into Ansible Collections based on the managed component type:

| Collection                                                                                 | Description                                                       |

Services are implemented in the form of Ansible playbooks.
Each playbook will integrate the roles needed to implement the service along with their own set of end-state and inventory configurations:

- Playbooks location: `playbooks/<SITE>/`
- End-State configuration location: `inventories/<SITE>/group_vars/<GROUP_NAME>/`
- Inventory definition: `inventories/<SITE>/<INVENTORY>.ini`

| Playbook                                                                                                         | Description                                       |

  -f Package   : Collection package file (-u). Default: none
```

### Common Use Cases

#### Register managed node

Use to register managed nodes.

The target node must be prepared for running Ansible (i.e.: have a compatible Linux distro, python3, sudo and openssh)

```shell
# Set bootstrap connection credentials. This is required for the initial connection only
export AP64_NODE_USER='sysadmin'
export AP64_NODE_PASSWORD='**change_me**'
# Register the host
/opt/ap64/ap64 -k -x 'host1.domain1'
```

#### Create Site

Use to create new environments. Each environment is an isolated set of inventories, playbooks and configurations

```shell
# Example: create site 'prod'
/opt/ap64/ap64 -c -s 'prod'

# List available sites
/opt/ap64/ap64 -t
```

#### Run A:Platform64 Playbook

```shell
# List available playbooks
/opt/ap64/ap64 -l

# Run example playbook on localhost
/opt/ap64/ap64 -n -p 'hello_world'
```

#### Upgrade A:Platform64 Collections

Use to upgrade collections from Ansible Galaxy

```shell
# Download and upgrade latest collections
/opt/ap64/ap64 -u

# Update site configuration
/opt/ap64/ap64 -r
```
